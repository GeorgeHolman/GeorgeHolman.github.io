    <td>PART ONE:For the first part of the lesson I was stuck on 1 problem. I had to put in mostly all my knowledge into one, which i found very hard to remember, however I persevered and with as minimal prompting as possible from my partner eventually did it.
PART TWO:
The next part of the lesson was focused on blogs. He said mine was good but needed to be longer (hence the longer one today)
( by the way in my blog I added translucency to the background to give that overall edge to it so that mine stands out)</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? .</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on my speed. Speed is key, but accuracy is also good so I don't want to go really really fast and not understand the question, but i don't want to take 20 minutes on one problem if you see where I am coming from.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will break the question up into what I do and don't know. The things i struggle on I will use the hint and if all else fails i will ask my partner. But before all this i will persevere and try to figure it out before any further help.</td>
