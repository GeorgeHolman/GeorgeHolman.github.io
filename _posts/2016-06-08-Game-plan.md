Today we started to plan our games for our microbit. I was paired up with Seamus and we got a dodgeball idea. Your player would dodge side to side trying to avoid the balls. It was a good idea so we went through with it. 

Sorry this blog fell short, we didn't do much apart from this and a survey. Iâ€™ll write more next time. Until then, then.
