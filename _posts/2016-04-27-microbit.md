In today's lesson we started to create some really hard code using the programme microsoft block editor. I built the sorting hat and changed the houses to the DCGS school forms. I struggled with the new programming techniques that we learned like inputs and strings of text and creating random selections.  I eventually got the hang of these by the end of the lesson and confident about block editor going out to break.
