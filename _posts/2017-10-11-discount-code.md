I tried to make it through it all, and I did, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a struggle, It was 

stressful, because 1 slight mistake, whether it is a space, it can send you looping in circles for 

hours and it's hard. You may not mess up and have no stress, it's not possible. So yeah I find it 

hard.</td>
