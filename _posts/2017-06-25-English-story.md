# The Mirror* * *


Toby was being driven to the car boot sale he was not willing to go to the car boot sale but on the way there he was thinking about maybe get something you might want but probably not because it was just a boring old car boot sale. *Great. Just great.*

Toby's mum gave him ten pounds to spend. He went looking for something to buy and saw something. A mirror was for sale and it looked in very good condition. It was a 5ft mirror with a golden border. Toby asked for the price and the man said it costed only a tenor. Toby further inspected the mirror but found no flaws.  Not even a scratch. He bought the mirror and headed home. 

It was the dead of night. Toby laid awake unable to sleep when he heard a noise. A quiet noise, but just enough to hear. It was like a children's choir humming. He was for some unknown reason drawn to the mirror. He knocked the mirror like you would a door and a big purple swirl opened up. Like a portal. Suddenly Toby got sucked in, and hit his head on the way out, knocking him unconscious. 

He awoke with his head throbbing and when he came to his senses he looked around. Straight away he could tell it wasn't normal. There was a purple aura in the air. There was no grass but only mud on the ground. If Toby was sure of anything, it was that he had to get out of here. Wherever* here *was.

The mirror was nowhere to be seen. Tony cursed under his breath. Toby looked around and heard a rustle in the bushes. "Hello?"  Toby asked as he crept up to the rustling bush. He was almost there and from here he heard whimpering. He had his hands on the bushes now and he was just about to pull it open. He held his breath as he was about to open the buses. He pushed both halfs of the bush to the side and revealed a, a, a boy?

"Please don't harm me." the boy whimpered.

"I'm not here to hurt you, I don't even know where I am." Toby replied

"What do you mean" the boy replied. He stood up. He was the same height as Toby and looked like the only normal thing he had seen in this place.

"I came through a mirror, although I'm not sure where it has gone."

"Are you sure?" The boy said very seriously.

"Yeah, I don't know where I am, who you are, whether this is real or anything. I don't know anything." Toby scaredly said. 

"Let me see your left arm." Toby held it out. “So the prophecy is true.” The boy said under his breath,”Let me start by answering some of your questions. This, 'world' that I live in is the Quadroplex. Yes it is real. Well I think it's real.”

"Quadroplex, what do you mean?"

"The Quadroplex is an alternate reality that I live in."

"What is this prophecy thing you mentioned under your breath?"

"You heard that!"

"Yeah."

"Oh okay then. One day in the Quadroplex long, long ago, the Quadroplex was a poor place. it was the festival of the dead, where we remembered anyone who died in the battles we fought. When all of a sudden there was a strong gust of wind and a big portal opened up. A human came through and helped us in our time of despair and gave us money and helped fortify our village from any attackers. He said one day a boy would come through and he will need help getting back so you have to help him. We asked How would we know and he replied he would have the sign of your village on his arm. And the he was gone. And now here you are."

"How, I got that scar from falling off my bike."

"I am obliged to help but I wary ou I am not a mind reader"

"So are you going to help me find my way home?"

"Yes. I guess I have to. Let's start by telling Lord Chica that you have arrived."

They set off, and suddenly Toby thought if he is in a  different world

"So what makes you different to us."

"We are nemchen."

"Nemchen?"

"We are basically the same as you but smarter, stronger faster and, well, better."

"So you're just keen at everything."

"Yeah, oh and we have no human emotions."

"Oh, okay." This was followed by a minute of awkward silence, well,
