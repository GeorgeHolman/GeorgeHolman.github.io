Today we had a code - gaming lesson. I managed to try all of them. Not many people have been able to finish a certain game are I finished a game called Light - Bot. The aim of the game was you had to light up all the blue tiles but you had different options you could go forward,left turn, right turn, jump, go to process one and go to the process two. Process 2 &1 are just another space for coding.

There were a few ways to use processes one and two you could use them for

1. Extra space

2. Loops

3. Patterns you could use more than once

Today was probably my favourite lesson and I enjoyed it lots.
