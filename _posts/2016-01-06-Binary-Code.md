Binary is a different way of counting. We count up in tens as we have ten fingers, but Binary code doesn't. The only figures it uses is 1 & 0. So if I were to say what was 1+1, you'd day 2, right. Wrong! In binary it would equal 10!This is because the code cannot use the number 2, so it goes to the next number it can. 2, no,3,no, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, oh but 10 can. Below is a conversion graph to show what binary is in normal code :

binary                                                          normal         

                                       0                              =                                  0

       

                                       1                               =                                 1

                                       10                            =                                   2

                                       11                              =                                 3

                                       100                             =                                4

                                        101                            =                                5

                                        110                             =                                6

 

                                       111                              =                                 7
