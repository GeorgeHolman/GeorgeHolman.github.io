  <tr>
    <td>
It was hard to know what was and wasn't effective to be honest. As it was a new programme so 

I was doing something not knowing what it would produce, but hoping the end product was 

what I wanted it to do.

I think work less on the type of information or the things that are irrelevent to the end product 

and get on with the core task at hand</td>
