    <td>Lesson:
For the first part of the lesson I was stuck on 1 problem. I had to put in mostly all my knowledge into one, which i found very hard to remember, however I persevered and with as minimal prompting as possible from my partner eventually did it.

    <td>I need to work on my speed. Speed is key, but accuracy is also good so I don't want to go really really fast and not understand the question, but i don't want to take 20 minutes on one problem if you see where I am coming from.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>

  <tr>
    <td>I will break the question up into what I do and don't know. The things i struggle on I will use the hint and if all else fails i will ask my partner. But before all this i will persevere and try to figure it out before any further help.</td>
