In the trust lesson we talked about how trustworthy certain sites were.On a scale of 1-10 we first, voted on how much we trusted wikipedia. Personally, I voted 3 but that was before he told us on the 'Nerd Army' who went through and changed wrong entries to right. Knowing this I would have given it an eight.
