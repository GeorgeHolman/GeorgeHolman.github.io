In today's lesson we learnt about the uses of social media. The good and the not so good. On the good side was advertisement, keeping in touch, reading news etc. The not so good side however was the likes of sexting, grooming, revenge porn and horrid concepts like that.

I learnt that the old sayings like, be careful in what you search, don't type bum in the search bar, was genuinely aiming to protect me.
