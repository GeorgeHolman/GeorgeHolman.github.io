**Lesson 3 Homework**

Assignment: How can your current or future social media activity affect your goals and aspirations for the future or how you want to be when you are older?

You can focus your response on things you have posted (if you use social media) that you might reconsider posting or deleting in the future. You can also focus on ways you have used or would like to use social media in positive ways that can help you with your future education, hobby, or career goals.

* I would like to have an account that would make other people acquire knowledge.This account would enable them to pass on that knowledge to a friend who would pass it on to his friend and so on.

* It would also be useful if i could talk to my boss, colleagues and people who I'm their boss.

* It would also be helpful if I could contact my clients to ask for preferences or details or something.

These three points would be extremely useful to me in a future job.
