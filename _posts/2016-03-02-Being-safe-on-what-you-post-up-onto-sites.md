In today's lesson we talked about how we should be safe about what we post up onto sites and what is an inappropriate post. We watched a video on some other people wanting to get a million views first. Then the competition got out of hand and there was some rude / nude videos on both sides. they all ended in a way that everyone got help and now i know that if I ever need help I should contact an association set up for this kind of problems.
