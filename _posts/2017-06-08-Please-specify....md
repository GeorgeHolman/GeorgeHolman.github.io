Todays lesson didn't involve codecademy, but i did learn a lot we were talking about commands and how we have common sense but computer programmes dont have the common sense we do. You have to set it up so precisely it's almost like teaching a baby to say 'mama.’ There wasn’t much to talk about because 30% of it i was confused by but next time I will be writing more
