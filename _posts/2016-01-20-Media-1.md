What is media? media is a way of communicating between people. I.E. T.v. or a painting portraying thoughts. We were talking about media and what it means. 

Then we were shown an advert and asked what the hidden messages are. here is an example :

Name of media example you deconstructed:  TV ( Mars advertisement - Winning )

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Who is the target audience in this media example? (Be specific)</td>
    <td>What is the subtext (hidden or underlying message) in this media example?</td>
    <td>What are the untold stories
(what information is left out of
the message)?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Either :

hungry people looking for a new snack.




or



People who want to win in a sports match or contest say.</td>
    <td>Buy the product 

and you'll 

improve to a 

different version 

of yourself. You 

will live a 

luxurious life</td>
    <td>You might get the 

other person to 

react or not like 

you rather than 

being friends. 

You probably 

wonâ€™t win.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
